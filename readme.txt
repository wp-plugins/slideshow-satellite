== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I am having some issues with my plugin, whats a good first look? =
Start with 'Reset to Defaults' on the top of your plugin configuration page.

= Still having some major issues, next? =
You may be dealing with a conflict with your theme or other plugins. To really test, if it works with Twenty-Eleven theme and no other plugins active it's a conflict.

= It's not that serious, just a little funky=
Oh, well have you checked out the Manual? http://bit.ly/stlmanual

= How can I display the slideshow in a sidebar as a widget? =
Install the plugin Advanced Text Widget and put the embed code in there. We would suggest using the Premium Edition as you can specify width and height in the embed.

= All the images show up on the page, this ain't no slideshow!!! Oh, and I'm running the slideshow through the template in PHP or through another plugin =
The slideshow isn't loading your JS or CSS most likely! That's because the plugin doesn't know it's being called. It's looking for the `[satellite` reference and not seeing it. `[satellite display=off]` in an area being called by the loop on that page or just going to Advanced Settings and turn 'Shortcode Requirement' to off.

= I'm seeing a non-stop loading icon on the page =
You're most likely dealing with some javascript weirdness. Check using Firebug and ask for help in the forums. Your theme or another plugin might be working improperly with Satellite

= Can I display/embed multiple instances of Slideshow Satellite? =
Yes you can, but you have to have the Premium Edition

= What if I only want captions on some of my pages
Set your default captions to off; for any slideshow you put on your page use `[satellite caption=on]` - Captions can also be set at the Gallery level

= How do I find the numbers to exclude (or include)? =
Not as easy as it used to be! Go into the Media Library. Choose an image you want to exclude and click on it and notice your address bar: "/wp-admin/media.php?action=edit&attachment_id=353". Therefore, `[satellite exclude=353]`

= What sizes can my thumbnails be? =
For Wordpress Image Gallery the max is 100, for the Custom Galleries the max is 150 pixels. The thumbnail must be at least 10 pixels.

= How do I show multiple galleries on a single page in a tabbed view? =
If you have the premium edition and multiple custom galleries setup do this `[satellite gallery=5,3,4,8]` and they will display in that order

= The slideshow loads a little funky, I fear it's the theme =
With premium edition, you can load the plugin after the theme loads by using the splash screen `[satellite gallery=2 splash=on]`

= 

Premium Questions

= My plugin breaks when I install the premium version =
Many times this has to do with how it was uploaded... Delete all the slideshow-satellite files from your plugins directory (this can be done by clicking 'Delete' from the Plugin Page menu) Then use the Plugin Page -> Add New -> Upload -> to upload the slideshow-satellite.zip file

You may also want to "Reset Configuration" from the Configuration page
