== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I am having some issues with my plugin, whats a good first look? =
Start with 'Reset to Defaults' on the top of your plugin configuration page.

= How can I display the slideshow in a sidebar as a widget? =
Install the plugin Advanced Text Widget and put the embed code in there. We would suggest using the Premium Edition as you can specify width and height in the embed.

= I have custom galleries in Slideshow Gallery Pro, will they still work? =
Yes, when you first install there will be a dialog box that prompts you to copy over your old Slideshow Gallery Pro files. Click the link and that's it!

= Can I display/embed multiple instances of Slideshow Satellite? =
Yes you can, but you have to have the Premium Edition

= What if I only want captions on some of my pages
Set your default captions to off; for any slideshow you put on your page use `[satellite caption="on"]`

= What if my configuration isn't showing up? =
You're most likely not running PHP5. Talk to your host to upgrade or switch your hosting provider. PHP5 is eleventy years old.

= How do I find the numbers to exclude (or include)? =
Not as easy as it used to be! Go into the Media Library. Choose an image you want to exclude and click on it and notice your address bar: "/wp-admin/media.php?action=edit&attachment_id=353". Therefore, `[satellite exclude=353]`

= What sizes can my thumbnails be? =
For Wordpress Image Gallery the max is 100, for the Custom Galleries the max is 150 pixels. The thumbnail must be at least 10 pixels.

Premium Questions

= My plugin breaks when I install the premium version =
Many times this has to do with how it was uploaded... Delete all the slideshow-satellite files from your plugins directory (this can be done by clicking 'Delete' from the Plugin Page menu) Then use the Plugin Page -> Add New -> Upload -> to upload the slideshow-satellite.zip file

You may also want to "Reset Configuration" from the Configuration page

== Screenshots ==
1. Slideshow Satellite with bottom thumbnails
